Notes on runnig FAST with the control subroutines written by Eric Anderson.

-Set the following inputs:
1        PCMode
2        VSContrl
2        HSSBrMode
0.0      THSSBrDp ! Turns on the user defined HSS brake model at this time

-Copy the following lines into the primary.fst input file after the Linearization control subsection and change values based on current simulation:
---------------------- DERATE PARAMETERS --------------------------------------------------
 9999.9		TimeDRStart 	-Time for turbine to initiate derating
 9999.9		TimeDREnd		-Time for turbine to start returning to full rated operation
 0.1		DerateFactor	-Ammount turbine will be derated (fraction of 1)
 9999.9		TEmShutdown		-Time to initiate an emergency shutdown of the turbine
 15.0		maxOverspeed	-The maximum safe overspeed (%). An overspeed larger than this will initiate an emergency shutdown.
